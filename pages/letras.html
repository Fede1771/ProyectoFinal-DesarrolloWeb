              <pre class="letra-cancion">
                Gimme gimme gimme some time to think
                I’m in the bathroom looking at me
                Face in the mirror is all I need
                Wait until the reaper takes my life
                Never gonna get me out alive
                I will live a thousand million lives

                My patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?
                My patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?

                I got this feeling yeah you know
                Where I’m losing all control
                Cause there’s magic in my bones
                I got this feeling in my soul
                Go ahead and throw your stones
                Cause there’s magic in my bones

                Playing with a stick of dynamite
                There was never grey in black and white
                There was never wrong till there was right
                Feeling like a boulder hurdling
                Seeing all the vultures circling
                Burning in the flames I’m working in
                Turning in a bed that’s darkening

                My patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?
                My patience is waning

                I got this feeling in my soul
                Go ahead and throw your stones
                Cause there’s magic in my bones

                Cause there’s magic in my bones

                Look in the mirror of my mind
                Turning the pages of my life
                Walking the path so many paced a million times
                Drown out the voices in the air
                Leaving the ones that never cared
                Picking the pieces up and building to the sky

                My patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?

                Go ahead and throw your stones
                Cause there’s magic in my bones

                There goes my mind, don’t mind
                There goes my mind
                There goes my mind, don’t mind
                There goes my mind

              <h2>Enemy</h2>
              <pre class="letra-cancion">
                Look out for yourself

                I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
                For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
                I’m searching to behold the stories that are told
                When my back is to the world, that was smiling when I turned
                Tell you you’re the greatest
                But once you turn they hate us

                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Look out for yourself
                My enemy
                Look out for yourself
                But I’m ready

                Your words up on the wall, as you’re praying for my fall
                And the laughter in the halls, and the names that I’ve been called
                I stack it in my mind, and I’m waiting for the time
                When I show you what it’s like, to be words spit in a mic
                Tell you you’re the greatest
                But once you turn they hate us

                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Smell the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Look out for yourself
                My enemy
                Look, look, look, look, look out for yourself

                _JID verse_

                Yeah
                Uh, look, okay
                I’m hoping that somebody pray for me
                I’m praying that somebody hope for me
                I’m staying where nobody ‘posed to be
                P-p-posted
                Being a wreck of emotions
                Ready to go whenever just let me know
                The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
                The enemy’s on my trail
                My energy unavailable
                Imma tell ‘em hasta luego
                They wanna plot on my trot to the top
                I’ve been outta shape
                Thinkin’ out the box
                I’m an astronaut
                I blasted off the planet rock to cause Catastrophe and it matters, more because I had it not,
                Had I  thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
                Kinda shockin’ they wanted static 
                With precision I’m automatic quarterback
                I ain’t talkin’ sacking
                Pack it pack it up
                I don’t panic
                Batter batter up
                Who the baddest
                It don’t matter
                Cause we at ya throat

                __

                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy

                They say pray it away, I swear, I’ll never be a Saint, no way
                My enemy
                They say pray it away, I swear, I’ll never be a Saint
                Look out for yourself

              <h2>Lonely</h2>
              <pre class="letra-cancion">
                Sometimes I can get a little I can get a little lonely Sometimes I can get a little I can get a little lonely

                Some nights I get a little lonely
                It’s even when there’s people all around me Sometimes I get a little anxious
                Cause these pills don’t work the way the doctor played it

                I’m starting to spin Needles and pins Right on the brim Hand on a limb Taking it in
                Sleep it away Life in a day
                No, day in the life Mixing it up Checking it twice Trying to breathe Starting to seize
                Lights, camera, action, and scene Story of my life

                Oh love Have mercy On me
                And keep me company I said oh love
                Have mercy On me
                And keep me company I said

                Sometimes I smile to keep things easy
                I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me

                So I’m playing the role Riding the bull
                Stuck in a hole Taking a bow Looking so proud Look at me now
                Talking about Pills in my mouth Under the tongue Isn’t it fun Trying to breathe Starting to seize
                Lights, camera, action, and scene Story of my life

                Oh love Have mercy On me
                And keep me company I said oh love
                Have mercy On me
                And keep me company I said oh love
                Have mercy Oh love
                Can you please have mercy on me Can you keep me company
                L-o-n-e-l-y am I so lonely Oh love
                Have mercy
                On me
                And keep me company I said oh love
                Have mercy On me
                And keep me company I said oh-
